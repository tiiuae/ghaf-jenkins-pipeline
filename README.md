# ghaf-jenkins-pipeline
This repository stores the [Ghaf](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf) Jenkins pipeline script, which will be used from [ghaf-infra](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf-infra). Eventually, we might want to move the pipeline script from this repo to [Ghaf](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf) repo. However, while we are still developing the pipeline, we expect frequent (possibly major) changes to the Jenkins setup which is why we don't want to push these changes through [Ghaf](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf) yet.
